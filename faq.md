## Pinup menu
The system is using POPUPPOPPER to launch the different games. You use the flipper buttons on the side to navigate the menu, and use the LAUNCH BALL button to select a game

The ALL GAMES button will show you the list of games installed on this machine. The Game Of The Month button will only show the current game of the month!

## Powering on the machine  

Should the machine be powered off when you arrive, you can turn it on in one of two ways:

* If the machine is completely silent, you need to power the entire thing on by clicking on the red button underneath
* If you can hear the fans running, there's power, but the PC is off. Click the green power button

In either case, the machine will power on and boot up PINUPPOPPER. Until the pinuppopper windows is visible you should not touch any other buttons.
